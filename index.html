    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to a mythological journey where two of the most powerful gods from ancient lore face off: Zeus and Odin. 
    Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, is revered as the ruler of the skies, wielder of thunderbolts, and enforcer of justice. 
    Odin, the Allfather of Norse mythology, is a god of wisdom, war, and poetry, known for his relentless pursuit of knowledge 
    and sacrifice. Explore their legends, powers, and the cultural significance that has shaped their enduring legacies.</p>

    <p>Zeus is the king of the Greek gods and ruler of Mount Olympus. His significance in Greek mythology
        includes:
        
        <b>God of the Sky and Thunder:</b> Zeus controls the sky, weather, and thunder, often wielding a
        thunderbolt as his weapon. He represents supreme power over the heavens and the earth.
        <b>Enforcer of Justice:</b> Zeus is the god of justice and law, ensuring that both gods and mortals
        adhere to moral order and punishing wrongdoers.
        <b>Protector of Hospitality and Oaths:</b> Zeus is also the god who oversees the sacred laws of
        hospitality (xenia) and oaths, ensuring social and moral harmony.
        <b>Leader in the Titanomachy:</b> Zeus led the Olympian gods in a ten-year war against the Titans,
        ultimately overthrowing his father Cronus and taking control of the cosmos.
        <b>Father of Many Heroes:</b> Zeus fathered many important figures in Greek mythology, including
        gods like Athena and Apollo, as well as mortal heroes like Hercules and Perseus.
        
        In summary, Zeus is central to maintaining order, justice, and balance in the Greek cosmos, and his
        influence extends across both the divine and mortal realms.</p>
