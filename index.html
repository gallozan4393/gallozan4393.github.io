<!--Zeus Intro-->
<section class="introduction h2">
    <h2>Zeus</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"><p>Zeus is the king of the Greek gods and ruler of Mount Olympus. His significance in Greek mythology
        includes:

        <ul>
            <li><b>God of the Sky and Thunder:</b> Zeus controls the sky, weather, and thunder, often wielding a
            thunderbolt as his weapon. He represents supreme power over the heavens and the earth.</li>
            <li><b>Enforcer of Justice:</b> Zeus is the god of justice and law, ensuring that both gods and mortals
            adhere to moral order and punishing wrongdoers.</li>
            <li><b>Protector of Hospitality and Oaths:</b> Zeus is also the god who oversees the sacred laws of
            hospitality (xenia) and oaths, ensuring social and moral harmony.</li>
            <li><b>Leader in the Titanomachy:</b> Zeus led the Olympian gods in a ten-year war against the Titans,
            ultimately overthrowing his father Cronus and taking control of the cosmos.</li>
            <li><b>Father of Many Heroes:</b> Zeus fathered many important figures in Greek mythology, including
            gods like Athena and Apollo, as well as mortal heroes like Hercules and Perseus.</li>
        </ul>

        In summary, Zeus is central to maintaining order, justice, and balance in the Greek cosmos, and his
        influence extends across both the divine and mortal realms.</p></div>

<!--Odin Intro-->
    <a id="odin"></a>
    <h2>Odin</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"><p>Odin, in Norse mythology, is one of the most significant and complex gods. Known as the Allfather, Odin
        is the chief of the Aesir gods and associated with wisdom, war, death, poetry, magic, and the pursuit of
        knowledge. He is often depicted as a one-eyed, long-bearded wanderer, wielding his spear, Gungnir, and
        accompanied by his ravens, Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory), who bring him knowledge from
        across the world.
        
        Odin sacrificed his eye at Mímir's well to gain cosmic wisdom and hung himself on the World Tree,
        Yggdrasil, for nine days and nights to obtain the secrets of the runes. He presides over Valhalla, where
        warriors who die bravely in battle are brought by the Valkyries to prepare for Ragnarök, the prophesied
        end of the world. Odin's role emphasizes themes of sacrifice, knowledge, and leadership in Norse
        culture.</p></div>
