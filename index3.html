    <h1>Odin: God of Wisdom and War</h1>
    <h2>Role and Significance</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"><p>Odin is the chief god in Norse mythology, ruling over Asgard, the realm of the
        gods. He is the god of wisdom, war, death, knowledge, poetry, and magic. Odin is seen as a god who
        seeks knowledge at all costs, often sacrificing much for wisdom, including his own eye.</p></div>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"><p>Odin is often depicted as an old, wise figure with a long beard, one eye (after sacrificing
        the other for wisdom), and wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a cloak. He is accompanied by two ravens,
        Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory), who bring him news from the world.</p></div>
    
    <h2>Family</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"><p>Odin is the son of the giant Bor and the earth goddess Bestla. His wife is Frigg, and his children
        include Thor, the thunder god, and Baldur, the god of beauty. Odin is also the leader of the Aesir, one of
        the two main tribes of gods in Norse mythology.</p></div>

    <h2>Notable Myths</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"><p>Odin is associated with the pursuit of knowledge and magic, especially runes. His self-
        sacrifice on the World Tree, Yggdrasil, to gain wisdom is a key myth. He is also the chief strategist in
        battles, including during Ragnarok, the apocalyptic event in Norse myth, where he is prophesied to be
        killed by the wolf Fenrir.</p></div>
