    <h1>Zeus: King of the Gods and Lord of Thunder</h1>
    <h2>Role and Significance</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"></div><p>Zeus is the king of the Greek gods and ruler of Mount Olympus. He is the god of
        the sky, thunder, lightning, law, order, and justice. As the chief deity, Zeus is responsible for maintaining
        the balance of the cosmos, enforcing justice, and ensuring that both gods and mortals adhere to the
        rules of the divine order.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"></div><p>Zeus is often depicted as a regal, mature man with a beard, holding a thunderbolt. His
        power is immense, and he has the ability to control the weather, hurl thunderbolts, and shape the fate
        of both gods and humans.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"></div><p>Zeus is the son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. He led the Olympian gods in a ten-year war (the
        Titanomachy) to overthrow his father Cronus, who had previously usurped the throne from his father
        Uranus. Zeusâ€™ siblings include Hestia, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, and Hades.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Notable Myths</h2>
    <div class="gold-box"></div><p>Zeus is known for his numerous romantic escapades with mortals and goddesses,
        resulting in many offspring, including heroes like Hercules and Perseus. His leadership in the
        Titanomachy and his role in many other myths, such as the Trojan War, are also central to Greek
        mythological stories.</p>
